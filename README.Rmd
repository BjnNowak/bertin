The main goal of this package is to easily transform choropleth maps into valued points in the way of Jacques Bertin.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BjnNowak/Lessons/main/fig/R_2/bertin.png)

# 1. Package installation

The package may be downloaded from GitHub. It may also be downloaded directly from R with the following command: 

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Installation directly with R (to use only once):
# devtools::install_github("BjnNowak/bertin")

# Once installed, you may load it into your R session
library(bertin)

# Two other packages will be useful to process the data: {tidyverse} and {sf}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)

```

# 2. First example

Several datasets are already included in the package and may be used directly. 

We will start with the population density of the French regions.

```{r}
head(france_regions)

```

A choropleth map of the population density can be easily created from this file:

```{r}
ggplot(france_regions, aes(fill=density))+
  geom_sf()+
  coord_sf(crs='EPSG:2154') # CRS for France

```

With {bertin}, it only takes one function (**make_points()**) to convert this choropleth map to a point valued map.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
regions_valued <- make_points(
  polygon=france_regions, # Input file (sf object)
  n=45, # Number of points per side
  square=TRUE # Points shaped as squares (hexagons otherwise)
)

ggplot(regions_valued,aes(size=density))+
  # Keep French regions borders as background
  geom_sf(
    france_regions,
    mapping=aes(geometry=geometry),
    inherit.aes=FALSE
  )+
  geom_sf()+
  coord_sf(crs='EPSG:2154')+
  scale_size(range=c(1,3))

```

# 3. Second example

In the previous example, the high population density of the Paris region overwhelms the differences between the other regions. In addition, the spatial scale is coarser than that of the original map by Jacques Bertin. 

We will now try to reproduce this map with the departmental scale dataset, also available in the package.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
departments_valued<-make_points(
  polygon=france_departments,
  n=55,
  square=TRUE
  )%>%
  mutate(density_cl=case_when(
    density<40~40,
    density<80~80,
    density<120~120,
    density<160~160,
    TRUE~161
  ))

ggplot(departments_valued,aes(size=as.factor(density_cl)))+
  # French departments as background
  geom_sf(
    france_departments,
    mapping=aes(geometry=geometry),
    fill="grey95",color="grey60",
    inherit.aes=FALSE
  )+
  geom_sf()+
  scale_size_manual(
    values=seq(0.5,3,0.5),
    labels=c("<40","<80","<120","<160","â‰¥160"))+
  labs(size="Population density")+
  theme_void()

```

Besides these examples for France, the make_points() function can be applied to any sf polygon object, with a valid crs.
